## Q1 ##
Write a function that will check if two given characters are the same case.

If either of the characters is not a letter, return -1
If both characters are the same case, return 1
If both characters are letters, but not the same case, return 0
Examples
'a' and 'g' returns 1

'A' and 'C' returns 1

'b' and 'G' returns 0

'B' and 'g' returns 0

'0' and '?' returns -1

## Q2 ##
It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

## Q3 ##
Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 

## Q4 ##
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. 

## Q5 ## 
In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible.

The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Examples:

[4, 10, 10, 9]  =>  [10, 9]
[1, 1, 1]  =>  [1]
[]  =>  []
